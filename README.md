The following is a curriculum to learn the fundamentals of reinforcement learning. The eventual goal is to apply reinforcement learning to a python object oriented system like game or a simulation.

Plan
RL Fundamentals
1. Markov Decision Process
2. Bellman Equations
3. Q-Learning & Limitations
4. Generate Q-Learning System

Deep Reinforcement Learning
1. Use Neural Network to approximate the Q-Function
2. Replay and Target networks
3. Implement with Tensorflow and PyTorch

Policy Based Actor-Critic Methods
1. REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)
2. Actor Critic
3. Object-oriented abstractions for policies, value estimators, and environments

Integrating RL into Python Systems
1. How to design modular, maintainable RL systems using Python OOP and software engineering best practices
2. Building reusable components: Environment, Agent, Policy, Trainer, Evaluator
3. Adding logging, visualization, checkpointing, and config systems
4. Patterns like dependency injection and interface segregation in RL pipelines
